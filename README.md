# Daisy_Chain_Priority_Logic_Block_Active_Low-Verilog-
This is a Verilog model of a daisy chain logic block that is used to determine the priorities of multiple interrupt sources. This block decides whether to propagate the interrupt acknowledgement signal to next block or not. A typical Daisy chain consists of many such blocks connected in cascade.
